In this tutorial you will focus on developing an application that will search, list results and play videos from Youtube. The main purpose (apart from itâ€™s fun to watch videos) is to highlight some key concepts of React to get an understanding of how it all works.

[NOTE]
To be able to do this tutorial, you must have followed the instructions given in <<prerequisites.adoc#,Prerequisites>>

. Go to the my-app directory
. Run `npm start`

This will open up the browser and load the url http://localhost:3000 (if not, please do so). We suggest that you also open up the browser's Developer tools window, showing the console tab. In some parts of the tutorial we will come accross javascript errors and warnings that will be discussed.

Now we are ready to go. Let's start by removing some code so we can start (almost) entirely from scratch.
