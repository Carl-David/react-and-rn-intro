= Video browser

In this tutorial you will focus on developing an application that will search, list results and play videos from Youtube. The main purpose (apart from itâ€™s fun to watch videos) is to highlight some key concepts of React to get an understanding of how it all works.

The tutorial is purposely designed to hold your hand and show you step by step what to do. The main goal is not to challenge your problem solving skills, instead we want to focus on presenting React concepts in small chunks, eventually leading up to a working application. With that said, don't blindly just copy and paste the code without reflecting on it. The tutorial will try to make you think about things here and there, but if you find any step confusing, please bring it up under the session so we can discuss it.

[NOTE]
To be able to do this tutorial, you must have followed the instructions given in <<prerequisites.adoc#,Prerequisites>>

== Overview of the application

The application we will create in this tutorial will look like this:

image::video-app-mockup.png[mockup,600]

If you think this looks awfully similar to Youtube, you are quite right. We will build a fully functioning page that allow the user to search for Youtube videos and display them. 

Okay, you might say, but why bother doing this, what's wrong with the official one? The answer is that there is nothing wrong with the Youtube video browser at all, and you should definitely not try to sell the one we build here afterwards, but we do think a video browser will fit our needs nicely in displaying key concepts of React. And as said, it's always fun to watch videos.

Now that you know what we will create here, let's start by doing the mandatory Hello World.

== Hello world

After you followed the steps of <<prerequisites.adoc#set-up-a-basic-react-project,Prerequisites: Set up a basic React project>>, you should have a basic project structure in place. Now we can go ahead and do the Hello World example.

The first thing to do however is to start the development server.

[quote]
____
. Go to the my-app directory
. Run `npm start`

This will open up the browser and load the url http://localhost:3000 (if not, please do so).

[TIP]
We suggest that you also open up the browser's Developer tools window, showing the console tab. In some parts of the tutorial we will come accross javascript errors and warnings that will be discussed.
____

Now we are ready to go. Let's start by removing some code so we can start (almost) entirely from scratch.

[quote]
____
. Open the `my-app` code project in an editor.
. Remove all generated files under `src` directory - but keep the directory itself
. Create the following files:
.. `my-app/src/index.js`
.. `my-app/src/app.js`
____

With this basic structure in place, we can add the root component of our application, called `App`. Let's do this as _class based component_

[quote]
____
. Add the following code in `app.js`
+
[source,javascript]
----
import React from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <div>Hello world!</div>;
    }
}

export default App;
----
____

Next up is to make React aware of our App component and render it on page. For this we will use the `render()` function on the `ReactDOM` object, which is the same thing as saying "React, please take this code that I wrote and shove it into the DOM"

[quote]
____
. In `index.js`, please add
+
[source,javascript]
----
ReactDOM.render(<App />);
----

[IMPORTANT]
Note the error log in the Console output. Apparently the application has no clue about neither the `React` and `ReactDOM` modules nor our `App` component. 
____

This is perhaps not so surprising since we must _import_ the needed modules and components before we can use them.

[quote]
____
. Add imports to `index.js`
+
[source,javascript]
----
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './app';

ReactDOM.render(<App />);
----

[IMPORTANT]
Now we have a new error in the console. "The target container is not a DOM element". Looks like we still fail in making React shove our App into the DOM.
____

The reason for this is that we haven't actually connected `App` to the projects' root element. You can find this element in `my-app/public/index.html`

[source,html]
----
<html lang="en">
<head>
  ...
</head>
<body>
  ...
  
<div id="root"></div>

  ...
</body>
</html>
----

One way in javascript to get a handle to DOM elements is to use `document.getElementById('root')`. This can be added as an argument to `ReactDOM.render()`:

[quote]
____
. Put our component into the root element in DOM
+
[source,javascript]
----
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './app';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
----
+
. Save all files
+
[NOTE]
====
The server on http://localhost:3000 will live reload everytime you save any files in the project. Make it a habit to do so on every change you do during the course of this tutorial.

____

The browser should now happily go *Hello world!* - congratulations!
